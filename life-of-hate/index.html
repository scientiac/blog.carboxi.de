      <p class="p-note">I am a computer engineering student who loves FOSS and is learning about privacy, the internet, and languages. I sometimes write poems, stories, and occasionally some articles too. TL;DR: I write things, test things, make things, and break things.</p>

    <h1 class="p-name"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flux.carboxi.de">Life of Hate</a></h1>

        <div class="e-content">
            <p>The thing about hate is that it lasts as long as the person wants it to last.
I have learned to hate things [<em>I wasn't like this before</em>] and the more you
think about it the more hateful stuff you notice.</p>
<p>Take microsoft windows for instance, I haven't even used it nicely [<em>yeah I am a linux guy</em>] but
I know so many points [<em>reasons</em>] to hate it, and once I made my mind saying I hated it, I found more
and more things to hate it even more.</p>
<p>Like <strong>love</strong>,  <strong>hate</strong> is also a strong word. And it is <strong>Heavy</strong>. Like love, hate also loses
it's meaning if used too often and too many times. [<em>I have used "too" here, don't say that it doesn't,
too much of anything is bad.</em>] And that is why I want the things I hate to be small and meaningful
[<em>It's kinda like unblocking some people on <code>&lt;your social media here&gt;</code> because the blocklist is getting crowded.</em>]
[<em>What do you mean you've never done it?</em>] .</p>
<p>Along with hating, forgiving is essential too. And letting people know what they have
done wrong to deserve hatred is one of the best things that can be done [<em>Also one of the
toughest things though</em>]. So, the life [<em>As in, something with life ends faster than something with half-life.</em>] of hate is as long as you want it to be and so is
the life of love. [<em>But we are talking about hate, here.</em>]</p>
<p>Though I am talking about hate and love here, it isn't really binary. You can have a bit of
both in something like, I love NixOS [<em>It's a linux distro.</em>] but I hate it because it sometimes
makes a simple things complicated. [<em>I mean, it'll be doable.</em>] [<em>But, at what cost?</em>] [<em>Time!</em>]</p>
<p>Enough of this talking, I have work to do. Lastly, learning to hate is essential, because it
has a purpose and like love. [<em>I am feeling</em>] [<em>cringe</em>] [<em>while writing "love" but not "hate", ohhh me.</em>]</p>
<p>[<em>Love a little hate a little more. XD</em>]</p>
